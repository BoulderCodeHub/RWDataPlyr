Description: Provides a tool to read data generated from RiverWare(TM)
    (riverware.org) in the form of rdf files into R.  Common aggregation
    functions, e.g., annual minimum values, are included.  Additionally,
    creating standard 'long' format data tables with common "scenario"
    attributes for the Bureau of Reclamation's CRSS results are provided.
    The get and tag data functions are written to expect "Scenario" based 
    output, i.e., output that is saved in different scenario folders, such as 
    those generated using RiverSMART(TM).
