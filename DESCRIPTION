Description: Provides a tool to read data generated from RiverWare(TM)
    (riverware.org) in the form of rdf files into R.  Common aggregation
    functions, e.g., annual minimum values, are included.  Additionally,
    creating standard 'long' format data tables with common "scenario"
    attributes for the Burea of Reclamation's CRSS results are provided, along
    with generalized, common, plotting functions. The get and tag data
    functions are written to expect "Scenario" based output, i.e., output that
    is saved in different scenario folders, such as those generated using
    RiverSMART(TM).
