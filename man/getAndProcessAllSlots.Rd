\title{Get and aggregate data from rdf file(s) for one scenario.}
\usage{
getAndProcessAllSlots(scenPath, slotAggList)
}
\arguments{
\item{scenPath}{A relative or absolute path to the scenario folder.}

\item{slotAggList}{The slot aggregation list. A list containing the slots that will be 
imported and aggregated, the aggregation method(s) to use, and the rdf files that 
contain the slots. Either created by calling \code{\link{createSlotAggList}} with a specified
set of slots, or a list of lists with each entry containing an rdf file and the keyword 
'all' for the slots, e.g., \code{list(list(rdf = 'KeySlots.rdf',slots = 'all'))}, which will
return all of the slots found in an rdf file. If this option is used, the code will return
monthly, or annual data, i.e., no aggregation methods will be applied to the data in the rdf
file.}
}
